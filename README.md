# CISC121-Final-Project

This project is a simple web application that **visualizes the Bubble Sort
algorithm**.  Users enter a list of integers and the app shows how the
list changes after each comparison and swap.  You can move forwards and
backwards through the recorded states using a slider.

## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking

The goal is to help someone understand how bubble sort operates. I broke
the problem down into the following computational thinking pillars:

* **Decomposition** – Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list,
  comparing adjacent values and swapping them if they are out of order.  We
  decomposed the algorithm into two nested loops: an outer loop that
  reduces the range of comparison after each pass and an inner loop that
  compares and swaps adjacent elements.
* **Pattern Recognition** – Each pass through the list “bubbles” the largest
  unsorted value to its correct position.  We recognized that after
  comparing and swapping neighbours, the last element of the current pass
  will be the largest in that segment.
* **Abstraction** – We display only the positions and values of the list as
  vertical bars.  Details such as indices or the exact values compared in
  each step are hidden to keep the visualisation clean and focused on the
  overall process.  The slider abstracts the passage of time through the
  algorithm.
* **Algorithm Design** – Input (comma‑separated numbers) is parsed into a
  Python list.  The bubble sort algorithm produces a sequence of array
  states which are stored in memory.  Output is generated by drawing a
  bar chart for the selected state and updating it whenever the user
  moves the slider.

## Steps to Run Locally

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.  Clone this repository or
   download the `bubble_sort_visualizer` folder.
2. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. A local Gradio interface will launch in your browser (by default at
   `http://localhost:7860`).  Enter a list of integers separated by commas
   and click **Run Bubble Sort**.  Use the slider to move through each
   step of the algorithm.

## Hugging Face Link

You can deploy this app as a Hugging Face Space by creating a new Space,
uploading the contents of this project, and specifying `app.py` as the
entry point.  Gradio will automatically run your app.  For more guidance
on deploying Python apps with Gradio, see the [Beginners’ Guide to
Hugging Face and Gradio](https://medium.com/@turna.fardousi/build-share-python-apps-instantly-with-gradio-and-hugging-face-cb36d100d5e9).

## Testing & Verification

The algorithm was tested with various input lists, including already
sorted lists, reverse‑sorted lists, lists with duplicate values, and lists
containing a single element.  In each case the visualisation correctly
displayed the intermediate states and produced a sorted output.

## Author & Acknowledgment

This project was created as part of a computing assignment to demonstrate
algorithm visualisation skills using Python and Gradio.  The flowchart
graphic was generated with an AI image tool.  Inspiration was drawn from
online examples of sorting visualisers but the implementation is my own.
